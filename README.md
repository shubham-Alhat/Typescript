# Typescript Notes

It is development tool not a programming lang for JS.
And All it does is static checking.. that its

1.Static checking and difference between TS & JS

_here left side TS code did not allow me to write code when there was error but at right there this JS does not giv any error and just allow to write further._

**Our app still runs on JS because Ts actaully get coverted into Js**

**This is static checking..**

### Another Fact that now it allow to write the kind of errored code.

## Installation of Typescript.

## Now, there are two ways of typescript installation setup.

### 1. Basic installation setup

**In this installation process, we actually install Ts globally in system only.**
This setup is actually to learn and know Typescript. eg. _how it works and what are basics concepts of it._

### 2. Project based installation setup

**In this installation process, we actually setup and config the typescript setup for particular project**
This setup is actually for project based.eg. _may be we are going to work with react or angular, we can config it with our preference._

## Basic installation setup

### This is for learning and going through basic concepts of Ts.

1. Open terminal or git bash.
2. Run the following command.

```
npm install -g typescript
```

This installs the TypeScript Compiler tsc globally. You can use npx or similar tools if youâ€™d prefer to run tsc from a local node_modules package instead.

3. Check the typescript version

```
tsc -v
```

## Let's get started..

1. Create a folder.
2. Create a file in it. `intro.ts`
3. Write some code.
4. open the terminal and run cmd `tsc intro.ts`
5. We will get `intro.js` file which is actually return by `intro.ts` file execution.
